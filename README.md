Crystals Collector Game

Here's how the Crystals Collector Game works:

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on one of the four crystals, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

When the players  total score matches the random number displayed at the beginning of the game, the player wins.


The the score goes above the random number, the player loses.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
